# earlyTerminationOfTransferLearningInReinforcementLearning

Machine learning algorithms tend to consume lots of time and computational resources to
complete tasks. So finding methods to reduce the execution time and the computational
resources consumption is important for the development in this area. Some effective methods
have been built to optimize it. For instance in the hardware level, multi-core technology of CUP
and the CUDA of Nvidia GPU have been widely used when working with computation intense
tasks. In the system level, Hadoop is a popular architecture used in distributed computing
systems. In the software level, transfer learning has made huge success. The background of
this project is using transfer learning to reinforcement learning. And it seems that agents do
not have to learn in the source task completely.

Therefore the goal of this project is finding a general method to early terminate the learning
processes in the source tasks of reinforcement learning problems. So that the consumption of
resources can be reduced from unnecessary executions.
